6. Broadcasting
Broadcasting is one of NumPyâ€™s most powerful features, allowing for arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes. Instead of explicitly reshaping arrays to match in size, NumPy "broadcasts" the smaller array across the larger one. This makes mathematical operations between arrays of unequal sizes possible without reshaping, greatly simplifying code and improving performance.
For example, you can add a one-dimensional array to each row of a two-dimensional array.
